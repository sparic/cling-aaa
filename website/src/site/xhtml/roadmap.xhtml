            <strong>Client/server profile system</strong>
            <p>
                Similar to what other, more media-oriented UPnP packages provide, Cling will most likely
                grow a profile system to help with device incompatibilities (for example, see the profile system
                of <a href="http://www.serviio.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;lview=article&amp;id=16">Serviio</a>).
                This issue and the design of the profile system is under discussion on the Cling list
                <a href="http://cling-users-and-developers.945824.n3.nabble.com/Device-Type-Detection-tp2217006p2217085.html">here</a>.

            <strong>Switchable XML low-level routines for Android 2.1/2.2</strong>
            <p>
                Android 2.1 has awful support for XML parsing and printing (broken schema support,
                no transformers), Android 2.2. is marginally better. Consider either dropping support
                for Android 2.1 and removing half-baked XML utility classes, or adding configurable
                low-level XML handling with automatic detection of 2.1 or 2.2.

            <strong>GENA eventing support in (and reactivating) the HTTP bridge</strong>
            <p>
                This has already been designed and needs to be implemented,
                see <a href="https://github.com/4thline/cling/raw/master/misc/Bridge%20Architecture.graffle">Bridge Architecture.graffle</a>.
