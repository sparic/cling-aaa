            The standardized UPnP AV <em>MediaServer:1</em> device template describes some of the
            the most popular UPnP services. Despite the name, these services are not about serving
            and accessing media data such as music, picture, or video files. They are for sharing
            metadata: The data about media files such as their name, format, and size, and a locator
            that can be used to obtain the actual file. Transmission of the media file is outside
            of the scope of these specifications; most of the time that is the job of a
            simple HTTP server and client.

            The XML parsing of DIDL content requires Android 2.2, it won't work on any older version.

            A <em>MediaServer:1</em> device has at least a <em>ContentDirectory:1</em> and a
            <em>ConnectionManager:1</em> service.

            <p>
                Your <em>MediaServer:1</em> device also has to have a <em>ConnectionManager:1</em> service.

            <p>
                If your transmission protocol is not HTTP but for example RTSP streaming, your
                connection manager will have to do more work.
