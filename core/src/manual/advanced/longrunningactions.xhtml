        <p>
            An action of a service might take a long time to complete and consume resources. For example, if your
            service has to process significant amounts of data, you might want to stop processing when the client
            calling your action is actually no longer connected. On the client side, you might want to give your users
            the option to interrupt and abort action requests if the service takes too long to respond. These are
            two distinct issues, and we'll first look at it from the client's perspective.
