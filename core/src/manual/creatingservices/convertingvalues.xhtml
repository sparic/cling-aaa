        <p>
            The UPnP specification defines no framework for custom datatypes. The
            predictable result is that service designers and vendors are overloading
            strings with whatever semantics they consider necessary for their particular
            needs. For example, the UPnP A/V specifications often require lists of values
            (like a list of strings or a list of numbers), which are then transported
            between service and control point as a single string - the individual values
            are represented in this string separated by commas.

            Cling supports these conversions and it tries to be as transparent as possible.
