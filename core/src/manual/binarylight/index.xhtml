        <p>
            The most basic UPnP service imaginable is the <em>binary light</em>. This device has one service,
            the power switch, turning the light on and off. In fact, the <em>SwitchPower:1</em> service and
            the <em>BinaryLight:1</em> device are standardized templates you can download
            <a href="http://www.upnp.org/resources/documents.asp">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the following sections we'll implement this UPnP service and device with
            the Cling Core library as a simple Java console application.
