        Cling MediaRenderer Screenshots
    </h1>

    <p>
        The following snapshot shows the Cling MediaRenderer window on the top:
    </p>

    <img src="/projects/cling/mediarenderer/images/Cling%20MediaRenderer%20Screenshot%2001.png"
         width="1003" height="772"
         alt="Cling MediaRenderer Screenshot 1"
         style="border: 1px solid gray; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>

    <p>
        For debugging you can expand the logger panel as shown, or minimize the application
        when you only want to watch video or have music streamed to the renderer in the
        background.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the bottom there are two videos playing, the instance identifiers are
        "0" and "1", respectively. The first instance plays the
        the <a href="http://www.bigbuckbunny.org/">Big Buck Bunny trailer</a> from
        a local source. The renderer understands <code>file://...</code> URLs, so
        you can instruct it to play a file that is available on the local filesystem.
        This also works if you want to mount your media through SMB, when you don't
        have a UPnP/DLNA compatible MediaServer.
    </p>

    <p>
        The second instance is playing a continous Motion-JPEG stream with 24 fps
        from an <a href="http://www.axis.com/">Axis web/security camera</a>. The
        image data is streamed over an HTTP transport.
