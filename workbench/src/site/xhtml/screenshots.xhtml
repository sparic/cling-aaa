        Cling Workbench Screenshots
    </h1>

    <p>
        The following snapshot shows the main Cling Workbench window with some open dialogs:

    <ul>
        <li>
            On the top left you can see the logging/debug control window; the workbench is a developer's tool for
            examining and working with UPnP devices and services. As most vendors violate the UPnP specification,
            fine-grained debugging of network communication is often necessary to understand workarounds.
        </li>

        <li>
            Top right you can see a demo device that implements a simple <em>SwitchPower</em> service as a light bulb,
            and <a href="/projects/cling/workbench/xref/org/fourthline/cling/workbench/plugins/binarylight/controlpoint/SwitchPowerController.html">its
            custom control panel </a> (a <em>ControlPoint</em> plugin of the workbench). All the way on the right
            is the generic event monitoring dialog of the workbench. When you switch the light, the monitor will show
            the change in status immediately.
        </li>

        <li>
            In the middle you see the device and service browser. The left hand side is a list of all discovered devices,
            the right panels show the metadata of a particular device and its services. The workbench supports invoking
            actions on services, and displaying the output argument values.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This is the built-in control point for <em>WANIPConnection</em> service and NAT port mapping on
        an <em>InternetGatewayDevice</em>:

    <p>
        These dialogs show some of the built-in control points, for <em>ContentDirectory</em>, <em>AVTransport</em>, and
        <em>RenderingControl</em> (volume only) services:
